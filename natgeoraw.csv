"Photo by @iantehphotography | The trip was a grand adventure: a rickety train ride from Hanoi toward Lao Cai, near the China border, then a drive up into the picturesque paddy fields in Sapa, where I met up with farmers for a final trek into  cardamom plantations grown under the rainforest canopy. It was also a lesson in Vietnam’s recent environmental history: Black cardamom, thao qua, an essential spice in pho and other Vietnamese dishes, was first planted in the Hoang Lien Mountains in the 1990s as a replacement for opium, a banned crop that once helped prop up Indochina’s colonial economy. The area, known as Hoang Lien National Park, is a symbol of postwar Vietnam’s efforts to protect plant biodiversity. Hence this puzzle: How could a forest simultaneously be a haven for conservation and agricultural cash crop?

Over a few days of camping in the forest, we observe farmers harvesting cherry red pods of raw cardamom with machetes beside a stream. In the afternoons, they smoked the refrigerator-size piles under fire till they turned coffee brown, significantly reducing their weight for the hike back. On our return, we stop at this spot revealing a set of lush green peaks before we dip down into thick vegetation for the remainder of our walk home.

"Photos by Corey Arnold @arni_coraldo | Learning to camera-trap wildlife, especially in urban settings, takes a lot of practice and luck. One of the toughest variables is predicting where the animal you are trying to photograph will travel within a frame, and this fence hole in Chicago narrowed my options for success. A parade of animals passed through here every night to access an underpass beneath a busy highway that connected two large green spaces. I was surprised to see one house cat show up almost every night, sometimes minutes before a coyote passed through. One night, while quietly adjusting the camera, I was nearly run over by a coyote running full speed through the hole, not knowing I was there until the last minute.

"Over the past two months, a team of archaeologists and forensic scientists has worked diligently to excavate and exhume 14 Revolutionary War soldiers at the Battle of Camden site in South Carolina. Based on preliminary field examinations, the team believes that 12 bodies are Patriot Continental soldiers from either Maryland or Delaware, one is likely a North Carolina Loyalist, and one served with the British 71st Regiment of Foot (Fraser’s Highlanders). 

“This is a rare opportunity to examine and analyze a large sample of Revolutionary War soldiers to get information about their health and diet, age, gender, and compare the forensic data to the historic record,” said Steven D.

"Photos by @andreabruce | In the article on “keepers of community” in the September issue of National Geographic magazine, read about Missy Nester, the publisher of the Welch News, and her small staff in West Virginia. They are part of the glue that holds their community together. 

It’s just after 1 p.m. on Wednesday, May 8, 2019, when the printing press kicks on. You might expect the mechanical behemoth to surge to life with a trembling roar, or at least a deep, low growl, but for the first half minute, this Goss Suburban newspaper press is silent. Soon the gears swell into a loud zipping that alerts the staff, standing in anticipation, to the first copy’s emergence. A machine of this nature, though imposing in size and gritty in appearance, is remarkably delicate and has taken an entire morning of gentle detailing—greasing, inking, brushing, wiping—before it’s ready to run a clean, consistent print. It is a process that requires a great deal of care. 

Spending time with the staff at the Welch News, it becomes clear that devotion to care begins at the printing press before bleeding out like runaway ink into the community it serves, finally coming to rest contentedly in the homes of its roughly 3,000 subscribers in West Virginia’s Appalachia.

It had been one year since Melissa “Missy” Nester had placed a bid to purchase the last remaining local newspaper in McDowell County. 

“We’re the only news source in the poorest county in West Virginia and—being that we’re the poorest county—media sources that surround us come in to tell only the negative stories of our county,” Nester says. “It’s really important for us to tell the positive stories about our county and encourage our community.”

Coyotes often feast on rodents and other natural foods found in parks, empty lots, and overgrown green spaces. But there are conflicting opinions about whether coyotes should be allowed to populate dense urban spaces. Pets such as cats and small dogs have increasingly been targeted as the coyotes expand across the San Francisco Bay Area.

The photograph was taken on the 10th day Naima received treatment, and her health had been improving. “We came due to drought,” says Abikar. “We lost all our livestock, and the farm was affected by locusts. Before, we had more than 55 goats and cattle were 45. Now we have only three camels, and they don’t give milk because they are malnourished.”

(2) The carcasses of animals that died from malnutrition and lack of water from the ongoing drought lay discarded outside Usgure village in northeastern Somalia. The animals belonged to a pastoralist family that owned 200 goats and sheep before the rains ceased. “At the start of drought, we lost two, three goats per day,” says Iqro Jama, 20. ""Then we moved here with about 20 and lost the last one a few days ago.”

"Photos by @erintrieb | Zahra traveled to the U.S. on a Fulbright scholarship August 9, 2021, just one week before Kabul and the whole of Afghanistan would fall to the Taliban. She feared for the safety of her friends and family. She knew that the Taliban regime not only forbade Afghan women from participating in sports but also historically had targeted Afghanistan’s Hazara ethnic minority population.

Zahra was introduced to long-distance running in Afghanistan, where she joined Free to Run, a nonprofit that empowers women and girls around the world through sport. She went on to finish three marathons there and competed in a Half Ironman in Dubai in February 2020.

Last year, Zahra ran the 50th TCS New York City Marathon in 4:59:41. It was her personal best marathon time by 10 minutes. She finished 6,826th of 11,350 women. She was the only runner from Afghanistan.

“Whenever I feel like I can’t run any farther, I think about all the girls and women who cannot run in Afghanistan, who cannot get an education, who cannot go to work,” says Zahra, who is Hazara. “Their problems are bigger than mine, and when I remember them, it motivates me to keep going, to do whatever I can for Afghan women and my family. The women in Afghanistan are the main source of my inspiration. I keep praying for them, and it is for them that I run.”

He lives with nine other bonobos at the Fort Worth Zoo, and they get along much like their wild contemporaries do, resolving conflict with love and affection over hostility. The noted primatologist Frans de Waal believes that bonobos may even have more empathy for one another than humans are capable of. ⁣⁣

"Photo by @estherhorvath | My portrait series on women in Arctic science focuses on climate researchers and explorers who work in one of the world’s most challenging environments: Ny-Ålesund, in Norway's Svalbard archipelago—the northernmost community in the world that's home to a diverse group of scientists. I capture my subjects in the magical atmosphere of a place connected to their work—and in this case, their dreams. 

Katie Sipes, a postdoctoral researcher, dressed as her favorite movie character, Frozen's Elsa. She took this costume with her on a permafrost expedition because she had dreamed of somehow finding an occasion to wear it in the far reaches of Norway, which inspired the film's fictional kingdom. With this portrait, she now had the chance. Sipes identifies with the character's call to forge her own path, and the idea, she says, that “strong females don’t need a prince.”

Her mission is to study Arctic ecosystems and the organisms that rely on them, she says, ""allowing humans to better understand the magnitude and incredible diversity that lives on our own planet."" And knowing this extreme environment better might prime us to better understand other planets, she adds. She's drawn by a sense of urgency: ""This endangered ecosystem is on the cusp of being lost forever. The purity of the Arctic amplifies the desire to preserve and study all of its hidden secrets that might change our world.” Follow me @estherhorvath for more polar science stories.",69478,https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/313293106_1050335848971878_2272045214374907483_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=nfnCCBuR74kAX9IvE2k&tn=ENLIY31XeBTMqW_2&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDc5igEMjT840i5CrPyOstqfSmpKGWq80Jbh3B9JtFmIQ&oe=637B0576&_nc_sid=86f79a

"Photo by @beverlyjoubert | Iconic predators like lions need space to roam. And space is running out. What remains of suitable lion habitat is under threat from human encroachment, climate change, and degradation. Without wilderness, lion numbers—and the numbers of so many other species—will continue to diminish. A new assessment by the World Wildlife Fund warns that across the globe, populations of vertebrates (mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish) have declined by 69% on average since 1970, with habitat destruction as a leading cause in all regions. To stem and reverse these losses, we need to focus our will and energy on preserving and protecting habitats—in short, we need to make room for wildlife.

"Photos by @alessandro.cinque | Near Ausangate, a mountain in the Peruvian Andes, artisan Francisca Huamani, 72, makes alpaca fiber handicrafts. (The light source is from an LED my assistant is holding.) In recent years, alpaca breeding has declined significantly as climate change alters weather patterns, with abrupt shifts in precipitation and ice melting as glaciers retreat. The effects include an increased mortality in newborn alpaca and shrinking grasslands where herds feed. The consequences are devastating the already marginalized and impoverished Andean communities, which struggle to adapt. The third photo shows Huamani's son inside the house, with the mountain behind him.

"Photos by @paoloverzone‎ | “Rats, and probably all social mammals, show the basic components of empathy,” says neuroscientist Inbal Ben-Ami Bartal of Israel’s Tel Aviv University, whose research was included in the magazine’s October cover story on the mysteries of animal minds. 

“Rats, like humans, can act aggressively or compassionately toward others,"" she continues. ""We are trying to understand the conditions that bring about each of these behaviors and what can cause a shift towards compassion, even for strangers and out-groups. With the rats, we find that it is positive social experience, rather than biological identity, that strengthens compassionate actions.”

In the lab, Dr. Bartal and her team tested what the rodents do when they see another rat trapped inside a tube for an hour. The free rat senses the trapped rat’s distress and is motivated to help by opening the door and releasing the trapped rat. This behavior suggests that rats are not only affected by others’ distress but also motivated to act for the benefit of others and their well-being. Interestingly, Bartal’s team also found that adult rats help only those belonging to their own social group, while adolescent rats don’t discriminate. This suggests that the bias to help others of their own kind emerges in adulthood.

Bartal’s study was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at Tel Aviv University.

It was referenced as a trade item on the Silk Road a thousand years ago, and it's still mined from active volcanic vents in Ijen. Molten sulfur oozes from pipes buried deep into the hissing vents of the volcano. As it cools, the sulfur hardens into yellow crystal blocks that are sorted by miners—who have only face cloths to protect themselves from the noxious fumes. Three times a day they carry loads of sulfur, weighing up to 175 lbs (80 kg), to the top of the crater.

My Thanksgiving plans had been canceled, and I decided to go for a two-hour drive. “Just to see,” I told myself. When I walked in the room, she beelined toward me like we knew each other. Kali came home that night. What I didn’t know was that she’d spent the first year of her life in a crate in shelters, had never had a family, couldn’t walk on a leash, was scared of everything, and didn’t for one second consider herself a dog. The lost soul soon showed her true spirit in the big city, where she quickly adapted. She was smart and eager. We learned about each other—and became inseparable. In time, Kali overcame her fear of life, learned to trust, and blossomed. She soon walked the streets as if she owned them, accompanying me to restaurants, bars, and any place that would let her in. She lived for our morning runs in the forest. She’s my sidekick and best friend. The bond between us runs deep.

"Photos by @rubensalgadoescudero | Monica Rivera Zuñiga is a mother of two, as well as third-generation mariachi musician. In 2020, I spent the first months of the pandemic at Plaza Garibaldi in Mexico City’s historic downtown, documenting how musicians at the “mariachi mecca” were affected.

Before the pandemic, weekends at the plaza included hundreds of tourists and locals alike, flocking to see the spectacle and cacophony of mariachi bands competing to be heard. Each of them vied for small jobs that would help them feed their families. From the afternoon until the late hours of the night, dozens waited on the main avenue, one of the biggest in Mexico City, almost stepping in front of traffic in hopes of even a single serenade.

But government restrictions in March 2020 put hundreds of these musicians out of work. The beloved mariachi are part of the nearly 60 percent of the Mexican population who are considered informal workers, meaning they rely on whatever they can earn in a day. This group is the most vulnerable to economic repercussions and have little or no access to government assistance. COVID-19 challenged societies around the world but none more so than in developing countries.

"Photo by @joelsartore | Found on every continent except Antarctica and South America, moles like this eastern mole @newildliferehab in Nebraska are often seen as garden pests because of their intricate underground tunnel systems. While their tunneling behavior may label moles as a backyard nuisance, they actually play a beneficial role in soil management and controlling the population of undesirable grubs and insects. By moving earth, moles facilitate better aeration of the soil and enable organic matter to travel deeper. Their tunneling also allows subsoil material to be moved closer to the surface, where nutrients may be more available to plant roots.

"Photo by @mattiasklumofficial | India is a country of roughly 1.4 billion, with a population density of at least 400 inhabitants per square kilometer. Yet amazingly enough, they've been able to save their country's own version of the ""big five"": the Bengal tiger, Asiatic lion, Indian elephant, Indian rhino, and leopard. 

India launched Project Tiger back in 1973, and the country has 53 tiger reserves, including Kanha National Park where this picture was taken. Tiger numbers are increasing in South Asia, not only in India but in Nepal and Bhutan as well. Populations are considered stable in the Russian Far East and in areas along the Russia-China border. In Southeast Asia, though, the situation is much worse, with the species having been lost from Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam around the turn of the century.

Somehow, I feel a little less stressed by my journey. Raising awareness of the plight of the planet's biodiversity has become a passion, and when I join with other like-minded individuals I think, and hope, that it can truly make a difference. 

It’s hard to believe that it was only in 2014—when I was based in Kenya and covering the worst poaching crisis in generations—that the last confirmed sighting of an Arabian leopard occurred in the wild in Saudi Arabia. The animal was sadly later found dead, poisoned by a camel herder. In the years since, an inspiring international effort has begun to preserve, breed, and reintroduce this extraordinary apex predator into the Arabian Peninsula—this one seen in Taif, Saudi Arabia. Unfortunately, when it has previously encountered humans and their livestock, the result has inevitably been fatal. So now, alongside rewilding, we need to educate and engage with the communities who will share their land with the leopard. They too need to be invested if we have any hope of succeeding, and that's where I hope my work helps.

Their diets may vary by location but mostly consist of fish and krill. They're capable of diving to depths of up to 175 meters (575 ft), though they usually feed within the first 70 meters (230 ft)—an incredibly impressive feat. Once they enter the ocean, they also face predators such as leopard seals and killer whales.

My partner and I live between Brooklyn, New York and Richmond, Virginia, and three years ago we adopted Goose from a Virginia shelter. They had rented out an empty storefront and filled it with adorable, adoptable puppies, all of which thankfully found loving homes. One of those pups was a chubby little three-month-old hound mix with dirt on his nose, spots on his ears, and soulful eyes. He slept on my lap the whole car ride home. He remained a sleepy, snuggly puppy for about 24 more hours, and then it was go time! Goose loves action, whatever it may be—playing with other dogs, fetch, running. Most of all, he loves it when all of these things can happen in water. Goose loves to swim, but he wasn’t always so comfortable in water. We first tried to teach him to swim in a pool, but he couldn't figure out the stairs. We had to carry him in. Then he couldn’t get enough. Lakes, streams, even the ocean—Goose goes right in! Watching him swim still makes me feel super proud and inspires me to be brave and overcome my own fears. // Dogs make the world a better place.

"Photos by @andreabruce | The story of the Blackfeet and Badger-Two Medicine, Montana, is about the protection of one of America’s last remaining wildernesses—a place at the genesis of Indigenous history and creation stories, which forms the foundation of every value in Blackfeet culture and community: family, education, identity, survival. In this story, the land is the keeper of the people. It’s where they learned about buffalo running and pack building from the wolves and got their songs from the birds. The Blackfeet way of life is imbued with the spirit of the land. One without the other means both cease to exist in the same way. Leaders are passing on those lessons, with increasing urgency, to Blackfeet in Browning, Montana. Each July, the nation’s traditions are honored at the North American Indian Days celebration. 

The annual parade “brings our traditions back to people living in the downtown,” says Darrell DeRoche, a Blackfeet youth mentor.“ There are some people here who have never been to Badger-Two. We are doing our best to change that, bring our traditions here, and bring people to the land. To keep our history strong.”

Whether the child owns a veritable fleet of miniature cars or a single stuffed monkey, the pride they have is moving, funny, and thought-provoking.

"Photo by @beverlyjoubert | So much curiosity and wide-eyed wonder in that feline face. And yet the wilderness that stands to be explored and ruled over by these top predators shrinks with every passing year. Africa’s lions have been eradicated from 90% of their historic range due to poaching, habitat loss, and conflict with humans. In the pockets of sub-Saharan Africa where they still maintain strongholds, their future is increasingly uncertain. Protecting and expanding space for lions to roam safely has been at the heart of my conservation work for decades. It’s simply impossible to imagine an Africa without them.

"Photo by Robbie Shone @shonephoto | In a place known as Secret Chamber within the Cave of the Winds, in Gunung Mulu National Park on Malaysian Borneo, scientists Stacy Carolin and Stein-Erik Lauritzen install a drip logger. The device will remain here for several years, collecting and recording every drip that falls from the stalactite above, which in turn is related to how the stalagmite grows below. It's part of a project to reconstruct the ancient tropical climate.",61288,https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/310817269_634972441619377_4965475106529491766_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=Ag2FWlVMjAMAX-TqhXu&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfA_3_AfEv-AAgBtrg_M73oFRLGdX3eGjRfef2hRUjQKtQ&oe=637B096C&_nc_sid=86f79a
