African painted dogs are very social, and packs frequently share food and assist ill or weak family members. Intricate social interactions are common, and the dogs communicate by touch, vocalizations, and actions. Painted dogs are endangered and faced with shrinking room to roam in their African home. They are also quite susceptible to diseases spread by domestic animals.

With its unique location on the world’s largest steppe, Astana is susceptible to extreme weather, sometimes resulting in striking views.

Since 1997, this once small town has risen from a forsaken landscape and post-Soviet rubble, transforming into a futuristic city. After replacing Almaty as the country's capital, Astana grew from having 320,000 inhabitants to over 1.2 million.

Before restoring the capital's name to Astana earlier this year, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev had renamed it Nursultan to honor outgoing Nursultan Nazarbayev, who announced his resignation in 2019 after serving as the first and only president of modern Kazakhstan for almost 30 years. Since its founding as a Russian military outpost in 1824, Astana has undergone several naming iterations—in fact, the city holds the Guinness World Record for most name changes.

It was also a lesson in Vietnam’s recent environmental history: Black cardamom, thao qua, an essential spice in pho and other Vietnamese dishes, was first planted in the Hoang Lien Mountains in the 1990s as a replacement for opium, a banned crop that once helped prop up Indochina’s colonial economy. The area, known as Hoang Lien National Park, is a symbol of postwar Vietnam’s efforts to protect plant biodiversity. Hence this puzzle: How could a forest simultaneously be a haven for conservation and agricultural cash crop?

Over a few days of camping in the forest, we observe farmers harvesting cherry red pods of raw cardamom with machetes beside a stream. In the afternoons, they smoked the refrigerator-size piles under fire till they turned coffee brown, significantly reducing their weight for the hike back. On our return, we stop at this spot revealing a set of lush green peaks before we dip down into thick vegetation for the remainder of our walk home.

This coyote is letting out a defensive warning—a howl toward the presence of a pre-dawn dog walker nearby. Coyotes often feast on rodents and other natural foods found in parks, empty lots, and overgrown green spaces.

I capture my subjects in the magical atmosphere of a place connected to their work—and in this case, their dreams. 

Katie Sipes, a postdoctoral researcher, dressed as her favorite movie character, Frozen's Elsa. She took this costume with her on a permafrost expedition because she had dreamed of somehow finding an occasion to wear it in the far reaches of Norway, which inspired the film's fictional kingdom. With this portrait, she now had the chance. Sipes identifies with the character's call to forge her own path, and the idea, she says, that “strong females don’t need a prince.”

Her mission is to study Arctic ecosystems and the organisms that rely on them, she says, ""allowing humans to better understand the magnitude and incredible diversity that lives on our own planet."" And knowing this extreme environment better might prime us to better understand other planets, she adds. She's drawn by a sense of urgency: ""This endangered ecosystem is on the cusp of being lost forever.

What remains of suitable lion habitat is under threat from human encroachment, climate change, and degradation. Without wilderness, lion numbers—and the numbers of so many other species—will continue to diminish. A new assessment by the World Wildlife Fund warns that across the globe, populations of vertebrates (mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish) have declined by 69% on average since 1970, with habitat destruction as a leading cause in all regions. To stem and reverse these losses, we need to focus our will and energy on preserving and protecting habitats—in short, we need to make room for wildlife.

For the other photos I made in the series, I captured six individual professional singers, performing as if they were in front of a large audience—in reality it was in a small private studio in downtown Tehran.

My Thanksgiving plans had been canceled, and I decided to go for a two-hour drive. “Just to see,” I told myself. When I walked in the room, she beelined toward me like we knew each other. Kali came home that night. What I didn’t know was that she’d spent the first year of her life in a crate in shelters, had never had a family, couldn’t walk on a leash, was scared of everything, and didn’t for one second consider herself a dog. The lost soul soon showed her true spirit in the big city, where she quickly adapted. She was smart and eager. We learned about each other—and became inseparable. In time, Kali overcame her fear of life, learned to trust, and blossomed. She soon walked the streets as if she owned them, accompanying me to restaurants, bars, and any place that would let her in. She lived for our morning runs in the forest. She’s my sidekick and best friend. The bond between us runs deep. Today, Kali comes everywhere—rock climbing, hiking, camping, road trips, and the supermarket. She is a master adventurer, always up for anything, and always up for a fantastic view at the edge of the Chama River in New Mexico. Shelter dogs are special beings. Never pass one up—they are forever grateful, and you’ll have a forever friend. // In honor of National Make A Dog’s Day today, help us celebrate our furry friends by participating in the @natgeoyourshot #MakeADogsDay Challenge!

By moving earth, moles facilitate better aeration of the soil and enable organic matter to travel deeper.

https://www.instagram.com/p/Cj21bC5Nu0C/,"Photo by @mattiasklumofficial | India is a country of roughly 1.4 billion, with a population density of at least 400 inhabitants per square kilometer. Yet amazingly enough, they've been able to save their country's own version of the ""big five"": the Bengal tiger, Asiatic lion, Indian elephant, Indian rhino, and leopard. 

India launched Project Tiger back in 1973, and the country has 53 tiger reserves, including Kanha National Park where this picture was taken. Tiger numbers are increasing in South Asia, not only in India but in Nepal and Bhutan as well. Populations are considered stable in the Russian Far East and in areas along the Russia-China border. In Southeast Asia, though, the situation is much worse, with the species having been lost from Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam around the turn of the century.

Since freshwater is scarce on the Galápagos Islands, this gorgeous lizard obtains most of its moisture from the prickly pear that makes up a large proportion of its diet. It’s estimated that between 5,500 and 9,500 land iguanas are found in the Galápagos. On Santiago Island, when it was previously called King James Island, they were so abundant that naturalist Charles Darwin had remarked, “When we were left at James, we could not for some time find a spot free from their burrows on which to pitch our single tent.” In the years since, entire populations (including all the animals on Santiago Island) have been wiped out by introduced feral animals, such as goats, cats, and pigs.

Their diets may vary by location but mostly consist of fish and krill. They're capable of diving to depths of up to 175 meters (575 ft), though they usually feed within the first 70 meters (230 ft)—an incredibly impressive feat. Once they enter the ocean, they also face predators such as leopard seals and killer whales. Fortunately, they're efficient swimmers, and they'll swim in groups to reduce their own chances of becoming a meal.

My partner and I live between Brooklyn, New York and Richmond, Virginia, and three years ago we adopted Goose from a Virginia shelter. They had rented out an empty storefront and filled it with adorable, adoptable puppies, all of which thankfully found loving homes. One of those pups was a chubby little three-month-old hound mix with dirt on his nose, spots on his ears, and soulful eyes. He slept on my lap the whole car ride home. He remained a sleepy, snuggly puppy for about 24 more hours, and then it was go time! Goose loves action, whatever it may be—playing with other dogs, fetch, running. Most of all, he loves it when all of these things can happen in water. Goose loves to swim, but he wasn’t always so comfortable in water. We first tried to teach him to swim in a pool, but he couldn't figure out the stairs. We had to carry him in. Then he couldn’t get enough. Lakes, streams, even the ocean—Goose goes right in! Watching him swim still makes me feel super proud and inspires me to be brave and overcome my own fears. // Dogs make the world a better place.

Neither foxes nor other predators can reach them in this waterlogged environment.

But only one in five girls makes it to the eighth year. This high drop-out rate is a result of early marriage, female genital cutting, poverty, and other factors. Each extra year of schooling, however, brings higher wages and a lower infant mortality rate.

In the past, many ranchers would kill the cats when they ate their cattle, but jaguars may be worth far more alive than dead. In a paper published by the journal Global Ecology and Conservation, @pantheracats biologist Fernando Tortato found that a cow in the Pantanal is worth $2,000 in its lifetime, but a jaguar in this area brings in $108,000 each year in ecotourism income.

The Pantanal is a shining example of big-cat and other wildlife tourism as one of the most profitable land-use types on Earth. This is all the more important in world so fixated on beef production and agriculture that clear forests and release carbon into the atmosphere. Local people need to benefit from living with predators, not killing them and selling their parts. A sustainable future includes people living with wildlife and an intact healthy ecosystem. Think of all the people in an area that work in ecotourism—running the lodges, driving the boats, guiding the tourists—and the families their income supports. If you save the top predator in any ecosystem, you save everything under it.

Not too long ago, the white stork was a wholly migratory species that would breed on the European continent and migrate to Africa during the winter. However, since the 1980s, the year-round food supply at landfill sites like this one has resulted in the establishment of resident stork populations on the Iberian Peninsula. 
 
The landfills have influenced the migration and facilitated the colonization of new areas. Now, with changes in EU waste legislation, open-air landfills are being replaced by facilities inaccessible to birds—which will again likely come with consequences for the storks' winter habitat, breeding, and migratory decisions.

https://www.instagram.com/p/Ci0J7K4uzEp/,"Photo by @jasperdoest | White storks gain altitude with the help of thermal winds. For this large bird, long-distance migration is partly dependent on gliding, which requires considerably less energy than having to flap its wings. The birds manage to do so by gliding on the warm thermal currents that rise over land, assisted by the prevailing winds. Thermal winds do not develop over large bodies of water, so sizable migratory birds such as storks and raptors are restricted mainly to land routes.

I worked on a story about white storks, and soaring with the birds is certainly one of my all-time highlights. At one point, we had storks above and below us, a truly majestic feeling.

Gabon is the second most forested country on Earth, forming part of the great Congo Basin rainforest that stretches across central Africa. In tropical rainforests, fog is produced from the temperature changes between day and night. As the rainforest warms, the water in the atmosphere evaporates and forms clouds—which generate rain the next day.

With its transpiration and evaporation processes, the tropical rainforest plays a key role in regulating Earth's water cycle. These rainforests help regulate rainfall throughout Africa, carrying water to the Blue Nile, which helps maintain the stability of the African continent.

This is an aerial view of the designated site, photographed in October 2021, on the island of Borneo. About 256,000 hectares (945 square miles) of a commercial forest will be developed, including 6,000 hectares reserved for a central government district. The new capital is projected to open in 2024, with the presidential palace among its first buildings. Construction is expected to continue up to 2045—which would coincide with Indonesia’s 100th anniversary of independence. 
 
On the island of Java, the crowded current capital, in Jakarta, frequently battles flooding and rising seas. The city was built on a delta, with 40 percent below sea level. With Nusantara, Indonesia could start with a clean slate. Yet questions about how the megaproject will affect vegetation, wildlife, riparian areas, and the Native Paser Balik people remain to be answered.

After multiple efforts were made to fix the leak during countdown, the launch was officially called off. The first attempt, scheduled for Monday, August 29, was also scrubbed, due to minor mechanical issues that could not be solved on the pad within the launch window. Weather also played a part on that day, as significant thunderstorms materialized in the area around @nasakennedy.

At approximately 4:45 p.m. EDT today NASA announced that the launch will be moved to a later date, possibly mid-October at the earliest—in order to make the repairs, the spacecraft will have to be rolled back into the Vehicle Assembly Building. In the meantime, the SLS rocket sits atop the pad at Launch Complex 39B. The goal of the initial uncrewed Artemis mission is to gather data on all spacecraft systems, leading the way for future crewed Artemis missions to the moon.

The dark-maned brothers had most likely been patrolling all night. At the time, the light was not optimal for photography, and I knew they wouldn’t go far, so I would return later and dedicate the afternoon to following them. I imagined the picture: they would stretch, roll, and nuzzle each other for a bit, and then perhaps stand to send out contact roars to the females.

As I arrived, the sky began to swell, the clouds a welcome respite from the afternoon heat. I parked for a view of the mound, with composition in mind. I watched as the aerial masterpiece continued. But the lions did not move. Rays of sun exploded through billowing cracks. The lions rolled over. The sun found a circular hole in the sky cover, and the termite mound exploded in a beam of gold. The lions did not move. I would wait until they got up. I was ready with a wide-angle lens. They never got up. 

The sun met the horizon. The afterglow continued into a crescendo. The lions lay flat. Perhaps they knew what I'd come for and laughed at my confidence, or they wanted to test my resolve.

https://www.instagram.com/p/ChfuBeKhSBr/,"Photo by Karine Aigner @kaigner | When most people think about a safari in Africa, they think of a trip during high season, usually the months of June through October, which, of course, is hands-down incredible. Indeed, sightings are epic. The land is dusty, hot, and brown. The tall grasses are gone. And since the animals must come to drink, a water hole is a perfect place to be positioned at.

But there is another magical time for an African safari, one that many never consider. Rainy season not only is a less expensive time to visit but also offers a completely different landscape—one of technicolor green backgrounds, flowers, and golden light. Sure, dense foliage and thick grasses sometimes pose a bit of a challenge spotting predators. But when you do find them, the images to be made are of a completely different level of awesome.

I had no trouble finding furries on this trip to Botswana. And I didn’t just find the predators—I found their baby versions. Two different families of leopard cubs and their mothers, and two different families of lion cubs and lionesses, graced the days. Botswana unveiled scene after scene of photographic opportunity, from African wild dogs to big cats to hippos, elephants, and rhinos. I think the rainy season is my new favorite time to visit.

We get anxious. We have come over oceans. We have spent money and time to lay eyes on that which the travel books promise. 

But the bush does not exist to appease our human demands and desires. It keeps us acutely aware of our small place in the wild world, teaching us patience and mindfulness. But there is always a moment, the space between our desires and acceptance, when nature chooses to unveil what we seek. 

The leopard and her daughter spent two hours here, allowing us a window to their world. As the sun began its departure, they rose, melting into the bushes.

It’s up to us to protect this iconic spectacle from threats such as climate change and uncontrolled development.

I've photographed snakes on all continents where they're found, producing two stories for @natgeo in the process. It's tough to single out a favorite species, but the Jameson's mamba, photographed in the rainforest of Cameroon, is a strong contender. Its venom is lethal; unlike other venomous snakes that specialize in just one kind of venom, the Jameson's mamba delivers a particularly nasty cocktail: hemotoxins, cardiotoxins, fasciculins, as well as myotoxic substances. The lethal characteristics of snake venom are what make it so valuable; scientists study the genetic and molecular makeup by collecting venom and DNA samples. This has led to the development of medicines for heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. Also, this does not affect the wild populations since all snakes are released after a quick field sampling.

The male giraffe (left) has a snare around his neck. Snares are traps, most often made of wire, set by poachers to catch animals for the illegal bushmeat trade. While many animals caught in snares are consumed for food, others will be left to rot or be so severely wounded that they cannot feed or hunt, drying as a result.

Across Africa, giraffe populations dropped nearly 40 percent in three decades, a decline thought to be linked to habitat loss and fragmentation as well as poaching, including animals killed by snares. But  giraffe numbers may be rebounding. An analysis of survey data from across the continent suggests the total giraffe population is now around 117,000, approximately 20 percent higher than in 2015, when the last major survey was published. The increase can be attributed to population growth in some areas but also to more accurate census methods.

Raekwon’s passion for music began when he was around 13 years old. He grew up in a neighborhood where everybody loved music and used it as a form of self-expression. “We was running around with radios in our hand, walking up and down the block,” he says. “Didn’t have nowhere to go. And that became our medicine of life.”

Reflecting on his career and the moment he realized people identified him as a legend, Raekwon says, “It hit me a long time ago that people really love what I’ve done and what my crew done. But I look at it as a thank you note that made people be like, Yo, you could do it. So to the people giving me that love was like a thank you note to myself.”

One of the roles music plays in Black culture is helping listeners “get away from the stresses and imperfections in our circumstances,” Raekwon says. “You listen to music, and it just does something to you. It’s almost like music becomes a vitamin inside your mind.”

Music brings both happiness and joy to the world. On Black joy, Raekwon says, “It’s freedom and having a great spiritual vibe inside of you. It’s feeling like you made it. It’s paying respect to our ancestors.”

Last year President Joe Biden restored Bears Ears as a national monument, reversing a decision that opened the park for mining and other developments. This also drove five Native American tribes off the land.

Earlier this week, federal officials and tribal nations formally reestablished a commission to oversee land management decisions of Bears Ears’ 1.3 million acres.

I was fortunate to photograph at Bears Ears while on assignment for National Geographic just a few short months ago. I hiked with Navajo guide Louis D. Williams (@louisdwilliams20) and learned about its incredible history. Camping out and photographing the view from the Citadel is magical. Bears Ears is an important and vital U.S. landmark, and I am thankful it’s been restored as a national monument.

In 1987, the two founding band members decided to perform on South Street in Philadelphia, thinking, says Questlove, “Let's try this. Let's see if people receive us.” Questlove thought it would be something fun to do, not knowing the path they would forge that day. “[It] goes to show that when you're living in your heart and with integrity, doors open,” he says. 

Their legacy motivates and inspires them to continue making music, and today they incorporate education and history into their performances. “Even tonight on stage—going through everything from Dixieland to soul music—we have to incorporate everything, like the entire history of Black music, in our set,” Questlove says. “It's not just about The Roots doing our stuff. We have to represent a whole culture when we go on stage, and that's why we do it.” 

Reflecting on Black joy, Black Thought says, “Because of the days and times that we live in, it’s a form of rebellion, so it's that we celebrate our Blackness in the way that we do and that we embrace it, and that's what we put out there into the world. It makes us disruptors. It makes us rebels, in a sense, but that’s what it is. What the ESSENCE Festival represents traditionally is just the deepest level of that Black joy. It’s people celebrating their Blackness and celebrating Black families and legacy, and it's a beautiful thing.”

I was transfixed by the greenish glow in the photos she texted: a light that people use to attract flocks of insects before dawn. Unfortunately, overharvesting and climate change could threaten this food of the future, and villagers have seen a rapid decrease in the numbers of bush crickets.

To get the story right, I had to rely on the community. I withheld judgment on the practice and pointed out the economic and nutritional importance of the insect. I came to watch, experience, learn, and connect, as I believe it is through mutual understanding that we can find solutions.

At least half of Earth’s oxygen comes from organisms in the ocean. That’s right—more than half of the oxygen you breathe comes from marine plants, such as phytoplankton and seaweed, that engage in photosynthesis. That is, they use carbon dioxide, water, and energy from the sun to make food for themselves, releasing oxygen in the process. In other words, they photosynthesize. And they do it in the ocean. Think about that for a moment. It means at least every second breath each one of us takes comes from our beautiful oceans. Today, take a deep breath and feel that connection. We need to protect them, so we can breathe!

A new baby can be a safety net.

The north coast of Java is sinking, and the sea is rising. While global warming is raising sea levels worldwide by around an eighth of an inch a year, the land here is sinking as much as four inches. People try as hard as they can to keep their land and their history above water.

I live just a few miles from the flood-prone villages, which face rising sea levels and land subsidence. It appeals to my heart to make their story known through ""Sinking Fast"" in National Geographic's July issue.

During the pandemic, midwives in Chiapas have been on the birthing front lines, especially in remote areas, despite receiving little support from local health-care authorities. As COVID-19 spread throughout the region, women began to fear hospital safety even more than before. As a result, Girón Pérez’s workload spiked, and she started handling two to three births a day.

I often return to the Swahili term and Kwanzaa principle of Kujichagulia (Self-Determination) and its focus on building identity both as a person and as a community, both historically and in the present day. It raises the question “Who am I?” I am made of my ancestors, my past and present moments, my community, and my neighborhood. Chronicling Black life for future generations, the intention for this project, meant not only visualizing the tenderness in my family’s gatherings but also utilizing the universal language of photography to record moments of rest, leisure, and joy in Black women and girl’s traditions at home and in play.

Little owls feed primarily on insects like beetles and grasshoppers as well as bigger prey such as rodents, reptiles, and amphibians. They're one of the best allies for farmers, helping to keep pests under control. Unfortunately the use of insecticides has decimated the populations of many species, including little owls. The lack of prey and nesting sites are other threats, mainly due to the rise of industrialized agriculture.

While researching the subject for a National Geographic article, I spoke with anthropologists, shamans, and local Balinese journalists, including my friend and assistant Tilik Wayan, whose father was a bit of a mystic himself. I learned about the temple on Mount Agung, in Bali’s Besakih village. The Balinese believe that spirits reside in this volcano.

During a Melasti (purification) ceremony on Petitenget Beach, participants turn their backs to Agung—the most sacred active volcano on Bali—and enter into a trance. Some press with all their might a sharp dagger into their chests (sometimes their heads). Having lived in Bali for more than five years, I've witnessed many trances involving daggers and never saw anyone puncture skin. It’s considered a blessing to go so deep into a trance, a level of spirituality not to be feared.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CeYYMW2sWKT/,"Photo by @beverlyjoubert | Watching elephants go about their lumbering business as the sun dips beneath the horizon, you may begin to wonder: When and how do these iconic giants sleep? The truth is that the pachyderm life leaves little time for snoozing. In the wild, it takes almost constant foraging to keep those supersized bodies fed with a plant-based diet—as much as 300 kilograms (660 lb) daily for a large adult. And then there’s the vigilance required when you live side by side with large predators; they may have few natural enemies, but caution is still critical. All of this means most elephants sleep for only a couple of hours at a time, and entirely sleepless days and nights are not uncommon. What’s more, unlike us humans, elephants pay little heed to sunset and sunrise when deciding on bedtime. #elephants #elephantsofinstagram #wildlife",967,239153,Photo,https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/285472430_721459555839157_3644905366977251605_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=VYycfTJ8L0QAX8ICxtO&edm=ABmJApABAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=Mjg1MzEzNjc2NjIyOTExMTQ0Mw%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfA1TKfrgpBtl2_jVLHmTjx91oEcI5nw8b-BEPofJAmq-g&oe=6388015D&_nc_sid=6136e7

https://www.instagram.com/p/CeJdxSZM9VR/,"Photo by @amivitale | Mike Learka cools goat's milk after pasteurizing it for elephants. For years, baby elephants lived off powdered formula—the same used for human infants—at the Reteti Elephant Sanctuary (@r.e.s.c.u.e) in northern Kenya. But when global supply chains were severely disrupted by the coronavirus, the sanctuary had to find a more dependable source of food for its calves, which had been either orphaned or abandoned.

Fortunately, the answer was right in their backyard. The sanctuary switched to local goat's milk instead of the expensive formula shipped from thousands of miles away. After extensive research, they put it the test and fed the baby elephants the goat’s milk. Reteti's elephant keepers quickly noticed that the young elephants were getting healthier—the goat milk was working better than the powdered formula from tin cans. 

Today the elephants are thriving. They went from a 50% survival rate of newly arrived young orphans to almost 100% survival rate at this most vulnerable stage. It’s also brought about a shift in the relationship between the community and the calves. Not only is it more nutritious for the elephants, it's also more sustainable for the planet and empowering the women in the community who are benefitting from a new source of income.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CeI7dneDbdq/,"Photo by @beverlyjoubert | It takes tenacity and toughness—and a dose of good fortune—to survive to adulthood in the often treacherous world that growing lions must navigate. For a young cub, threats can emerge at every turn. There is hunger and injury and the menace of rival carnivores like leopards and hyenas. But there are also dangers much closer to home, woven into the complex social dynamics of a pride, where violent skirmishes for control can quickly turn fatal. Add humans into the mix and the threats quickly multiply, as poaching, hunting, and habitat loss further disrupt pride structures. It is not hard to imagine why some estimates suggest that up to 80% of lion cubs die before the age of two. We may not be able to shield them from much of the dangers of lion life, but we can ensure that our own actions don’t diminish their odds even further.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CeHbVDsu_T4/,"Photo by @jasperdoest | In Gabon’s Lopé National Park, the doughnut-shaped fruit of the Omphalocarpum procerum grows on its branches and trunk, which is common for rainforest trees. Scientists believe it’s an adaptation to promote pollination by insects, such as ants, found in the trees.

Like most of the plant species found in Lopé, Omphalocarpum trees rely on animals to disperse their seeds. Only elephants have jaws strong enough to crack open the hard, thick shells, swallowing—and passing—the intact seeds and making them more likely to germinate. The trees rely on these elephants for survival as much as the elephants depend on the fruits. In parts of Africa where poaching has eliminated forest elephants, Omphalocarpum fruits rot on the ground, leaving their seeds wasted and the trees unable to reproduce. 

No species of animal or plant can survive alone. They are all part of an ecosystem within which a complex web of interactions exists. If any strand of that web is broken, it will result in distortions that are difficult to predict and may be impossible to repair.

They command their own space and enjoy showing off their presence. I'm like a devoted bird watcher.

These vehicles rest against backgrounds of varying ambient light, from the winding streets of the Hollywood Hills to the grid-like suburbs of the valley. Nestled in the low-lying fog of these distinctly Los Angeles neighborhoods, the vehicles begin to take on personalities of their own.

That means a herd can’t afford to slow down, not even for its youngest—or most pregnant—members.

The long elephant gestation period (nearly two years!) certainly helps here: It means calves are born ready to face such physical demands.

Peatlands are a type of wetland that originates from organic material left behind in a lagoon or swamp by glaciers. They have many virtues, such as water regulation and the ability to conserve paleoenvironmental information. Most important: They retain carbon dioxide in enormous quantities, even more than forests do. Peatlands are fundamental in the fight to mitigate climate change. And here, in Tierra del Fuego, we find the largest in South America. Peatlands are magical beings. They are connectors: They connect land and water; life and death; the past, the present, and our future. For the past few years I've been working on peatlands' symbolic and conceptual elements and their bond with the community.

The blaze was accidentally sparked under the roof and burned for 15 hours. In the aftermath, some called for a more contemporary approach to rebuilding the cathedral, but French president Emmanuel Macron promised that Notre Dame, which took almost 200 years to build, would be restored to its previous state. After more than two years of rescue and removal, the restoration is finally beginning.

I had long wanted to do a Day to Night of Notre Dame, and I found a great location from the Pont de la Tournelle with the lights of the tour boats illuminating the cathedral. The beauty and history of this building are inspiring, and I am fortunate to have been able to experience Notre Dame up close.

In the Day to Night series, epic landscapes are portrayed from a fixed camera angle, capturing fleeting moments of humanity and nature as light passes in front of the lens over the course of a full day.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CcWuc40sPk0/,"Photo by Luján Agusti @lujanag | This is a detail of vegetation found near a peat bog in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina, that was left dry because of peat extraction. Peatlands are a type of wetland that originates from organic material left behind in a lagoon or swamp by glaciers. They have many virtues, such as water regulation and the ability to conserve paleoenvironmental information. Most important: They retain carbon dioxide in enormous quantities, even more than forests do. Peatlands are fundamental in the fight to mitigate climate change. And here, in Tierra del Fuego, we find the largest in South America. Peatlands are magical beings. They are connectors: They connect land and water; life and death; the past, the present, and our future. For the past few years I've been working on peatlands' symbolic and conceptual elements and their bond with the community.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CcVbxtlOFn1/,"Photo by @javier_aznar_photography | I am not sure what I was thinking when I decided to take a photo of an army ant (Eciton sp.) biting my finger. I knew it would hurt at least a little, as those are some big jaws. What I did not expect was the ant stinging me with its abdomen. Because I did not want to kill the ant, I had to wait 20 very long seconds until it decided to leave. Long story short, for five days my finger was so fat and swollen I couldn't bend it. Luckily, it was more uncomfortable than painful, but I learned my lesson: Never play around with army ants or other venomous animals.

My job as a photographer and filmmaker is not always easy, but it's given me a dynamic and rarely uneventful life. I've also been fortunate enough to work with skilled colleagues. In this case, with the highly venomous and extremely rare water cobra, I wouldn’t have managed so well without the assistance of Samuel (my camera assistant at the time) and herpetologist Zoltán Takács. We are better for the help and support we get.
